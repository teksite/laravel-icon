## Installation

### Step 1: Install via Composer
Run the following command in your CLI:

```bash
composer require teksite\icon-laravel
```


### Step 3: Define gates in the AppServiceProvider
For laravel 5 or higher version, GatesServiceProvider is discovered automatically, so you don't need to do anything

#### Laravel 5.x and earlier
If you are using Laravel 5.x or earlier, register the service provider in the `config/app.php` file under the `providers` array:

```php
'providers' => [
    // Other Service Providers
    Teksite\Authorize\IconLaravelServiceProvider::class,
];
```

> **Note:** This step is not required for newer versions of Laravel (5.x and above).

---

## Use
Add trait `\Teksite\Authorize\TraitsHasAuthorization` to any model that you want to implement authorization on it such as User model.

### Using in blades
it can be used by own laravel directive for example for users with `can` directive:
```bladehtml
@can('permission')
    \\ your codes
@endcan
```
or

```bladehtml
@canany(['permission1' , permission2])
    \\ your codes
@endcanany
```
in the above code the permission is checked for the current (logged in) user if he/she has the permissions or his/her roles have the permission.
